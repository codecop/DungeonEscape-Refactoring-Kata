Dungeon Escape Refactoring Kata
================================

Try your luck with this Dungeon Escape game. There are two ways to win. Either find your friend Freija who rescues you. Alternatively you can find the other escaped prisonor. Note you will need to run two instances of the game for this second scenario, so you have two escaped prisoners at once.

The design of this code involves a little more duplication than we're comfortable with. Before you refactor it you will need tests. How can you design tests for a command-line program that needs user input?
