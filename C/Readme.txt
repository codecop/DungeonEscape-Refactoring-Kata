* 15' Test setup with coverage
* 45' 88% coverage with Smoke
* 45' Refactor basic duplication
    - typo Quit/quit
    - typo Contragulations
* 3h Refactor structure for Scenarios and unify all scenarios, extract basic framework
* 1h Simplifying/modularity, split and extract.
    - two scenarios with forks in them
    - one scenario with extra logic in method
* 1h Fooling around, rename again and again, extract fork. No more ideas.
* 0.5h new feature is just another two structs. WIN
